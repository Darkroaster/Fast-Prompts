# Fast Prompts

---

## Overview

This is a curated repository of **AI prompts** that I've personally tested and verified for daily work and learning tasks. Its purpose is to facilitate more efficient interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs), saving you the effort of repeatedly brainstorming and crafting prompts for new tasks.

## Why Was This Repository Created?

While LLMs are getting smarter, they're also becoming harder to control. Many existing prompt shares are too brief to meet the demands of practical applications.

I created this repository so I can directly copy pre-verified prompts whenever I encounter a new task. All prompts within this repository have been personally tested and validated by me, ensuring their practicality and effectiveness in specific scenarios.

### Important Notes

* **Model Compatibility:** The prompts in this repository have primarily been tested and verified for good performance with the **Gemini** model. When used with other Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), the results may vary, and some adjustments might be necessary.
* **Randomness:** The content generated by Large Language Models has a degree of randomness. Even with the same prompt, the output may differ each time, and successful results aren't guaranteed every time. If the outcome isn't ideal, you might need to fine-tune the prompt.

## Contribution

If you also have tested and effective AI prompts that you're willing to share, we warmly welcome your contributions through the following methods:

* **Submit an Issue:** Describe your prompt, its use case, applicable scenarios, and the model you used.
* **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Directly add your prompt as a Markdown file to the repository. Please ensure your prompt is clearly described and include the model you've validated it with, along with any usage tips.
